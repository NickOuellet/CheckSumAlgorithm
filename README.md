# CheckSumAlgorithm
I created a checksum algorithm to determine if binary messages between two machines were compromised in transit. In order to simulate corruption I randomly selected a bit to flip when a message is sent (occurs 33% of the time). Takes binary message input

// In order to run, first run the server file in a terminal window
// Then, create a second terminal window and compile the client file. When running the client file, use the IP address "localhost" and the terminal windows should conect. 
//Now the program is ready to accept input
